    <h5>Welcome!</h5>
    <p>You are looking at a new user interface ("UI") for an information resource derived from the database and software
        developed at the <i>Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus</i> project
        ("<a href="https://stedt.berkeley.edu/">STEDT</a>"). This UI uses the
        <a href="https://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a> 'discovery framework' (version <%= Blacklight::VERSION %>) and
        presents lexical and etymological data extracted from the original
        database in an interesting and easy-to-navigate way.
    </p>
    <p>(STEDT was a long-term linguistics research project at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of
        California at Berkeley</a>. The result was the publication in 2016 of an
        etymological dictionary of Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), the ancestor language of the large Sino-Tibetan language
        family.
        The project was started in 1987 and enjoyed the support of the
        <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> and the
        <a href="http://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>. Please visit the STEDT site for
        complete acknowledgements or consult
        the <a href="https://stedt.berkeley.edu/node/124.html">Dictionary Thesaurus itself</a>.)
    </p>
    <h5>A few pointers</h5>
    <p>The search engine points to a collection of the 530,480 lexical entries in
        the original database. You can slice-and-dice this data according to the content of the fields
        in the lexical entries (e.g. gloss, form, language name, language subgroup, etc.) using the search bar
        at the top or the facets on the left side.
    </p>
    <p>The search bar at the top allows you to search by one or more <b>keywords</b>.
        The default <i>Any field</i> field at the left will search for your keywords anywhere in a record; selecting a
        particular field in this dropdown will restrict the search.
        The <b>facets</b> at the left are dropdowns which enumerate the values
        in the faceted field and allow you to do an <i>exact search</i> for the shown value.
    </p>
    <p>So for example you can search for 'tibetan barley' using the Any Field in the search bar,
        you'll get all the records where these two keywords appear in the record. You can see by looking
        at the facets that 'barley' is used in several collocations in the Gloss field and that 'tibetan'
        retrieves a number of different Tibetan dialects.
        <img src="/assets/tbdb-v1.png">
        If you want to search for just the Gloss 'tibetan barley', you can put the term in quotes and specify
        only the Gloss field should be searched.
